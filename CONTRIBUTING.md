# Contributing

Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to this project.  

Currently the impact of the project is small. I have one goal;

> Create a roulating list, animated to imply activity.  
> All combined into a nice Polymer element, to be reused in other projects (Magic mirror).  

## Future improvements

1. Support deleting of ```<carrousel-list-item>``` elements, dynamically. I didn't have the need for it yet...
2. Make animation type 'MOVE-Y' more generic as in MOVE; (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) - using coordinates.
3. EASE-IN, EASY-OUT effects.

If you have other ideas, improvements, please add them.

Pieter
