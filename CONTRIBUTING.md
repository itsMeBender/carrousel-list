# Contributing

Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to this project.  

Currently the impact of the project is small. I have one goal;

> Create a roulating list, animated to imply activity.  
> All combined into a nice Polymer element, to be reused in other projects (Magic mirror).  

## To do

1. Support deleting of ```<carrousel-list-item>``` elements, dynamically. I didn't have the need for it yet...

If you have other ideas, improvements, please add them. Maybe a live link to [BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com/).
